# Analysis of SPY Options Data (Sep-Dec 2022)

This analysis delves into the SPY options dataset to discern the relationship between SPY levels and gamma exposure, focusing primarily on the latter part of 2022.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

The SPY options data was loaded from a provided CSV file. During the initial inspection, some columns were identified as having been interpreted as strings due to inconsistencies in the data. These were rectified by converting them to the appropriate data types.

## Gamma Exposure Calculation

Gamma exposure was computed in the following manner:
1. Calculated gamma exposure for each option:
    - Call Gamma Exposure = Call Gamma x Spot Price x Volume
    - Put Gamma Exposure = Put Gamma x Spot Price x Volume
2. The gamma exposures for each day were aggregated to determine the net gamma exposure.

## Incorporating Implied Volatility

To enhance the analysis, gamma exposure was adjusted for implied volatility (IV):
1. Gamma was weighted by its respective IV:
    - IV-weighted Call Gamma Exposure = Call Gamma x Spot Price x Call IV
    - IV-weighted Put Gamma Exposure = Put Gamma x Spot Price x Put IV
2. The net IV-weighted gamma exposure was computed for each day.

## Visualizations

Two distinct visual analyses were conducted:
1. A plot showing SPY levels alongside daily gamma exposure.
2. A second plot contrasting SPY levels with IV-weighted gamma exposure.

## Future Simplified Analyses

Once more computing power is available, several other sophisticated analyses are proposed:

- **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate correlations between SPY levels and gamma exposure metrics.
- **Regression Analysis**: Regress gamma exposure on SPY levels and test the statistical significance.
- **Threshold Analysis**: Identify if high/low gamma exposure thresholds can predict future SPY support/resistance levels.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Compare realized volatility of SPY during different gamma exposure regimes.
- **Event Studies**: Analyze specific events like FOMC announcements and their impact on gamma exposure.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Explore if gamma exposure distributions vary across different SPY level quantiles.
- **Timeseries Modeling**: Use VAR or other timeseries models to predict gamma exposure.
- **Network Graphs**: Visualize Granger-causality networks between SPY, gamma exposure, and VIX.
- **Regime Analysis**: Cluster SPY levels into volatility regimes and compare gamma exposures within each regime.

The ultimate goal is to quantify predictive relationships, assess risk profiles, and understand the implications of high gamma exposure on the future direction of SPY.
